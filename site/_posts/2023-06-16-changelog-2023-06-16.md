## New trading experience

We've released our new trading experience on Arbitrum GÃ¶rli, building on Valorem Clear and
Valorem Trade. This will allow users to trade options on any Arbitrum GÃ¶rli ERC20.

## New strategy â€”Â Long call

Our first option trading strategy! Traders can now open Long call positions on digital assets, selecting from a set of 5
strikes and the next 4 Fridays.

## Request-for-comment on Trade API reference

We published our preliminary reference docs for the Trade API, along with a request-for-comment. We received good
feedback from our initial market making partnerships and DeFi protocol integrators.
