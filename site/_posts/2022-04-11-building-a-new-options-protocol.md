### Where We Are

We started building a new option protocol last month. We've been working 
rapidly towards a minimum viable product, and are pleased to announce that 
Valorem will be launching on the Harmony testnet later this week. We are 
excited to start onboarding some Alpha testers via our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/5jZdPuY9kR).
Please join and let us know if you want to be an early tester.

### Where We Are Going

That's the beginning, but after that there is a lot more to be built. We 
are planning a UI and Harmony Mainnet launch for May first. We are also 
starting to design some of the broader tokenomics for an ecosystem of 
structured products which will overlay the settlement layer. More to follow
on that, along with a few examples of how to build structured products atop
Valorem.

### How We Are Going to Get There

We look forward to the feedback from our users, and in choosing two or three 
two sided structured product designs to build for writers and option holders 
to use. One use case we are immediately excited to build, is vesting options 
for protocol contributor renumeration.
