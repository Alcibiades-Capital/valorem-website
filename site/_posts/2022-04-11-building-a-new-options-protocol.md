We started building a new option protocol last month. Valorem will be launching 
on the Harmony testnet later this week, and will have a UI and mainnet launch 
targeting May 1. That's the beginning, but after that there is a lot more to 
be built. We are excited to start onboarding some Alpha testers via our 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/5jZdPuY9kR). Please join and let us know if you 
want to be an early tester.

We are also starting to design some of the broader tokenomics for an ecosystem 
of structured products which will overlay the settlement layer. More to follow 
on that, along with a few examples of how to build structured products atop 
Valorem.
