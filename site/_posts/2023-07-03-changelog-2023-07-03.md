## Migrate to WalletConnect v2

WalletConnect v2 was a breaking change that all integrating dapps faced in June. We worked through a number of edge cases to ensure that the transition was as smooth as possible for all manner of OS / browser / wallet combos.

## Expiry usability

For the expiries featured in the Valorem Trade dapp, we added a helpful signifier showing how much time remains until expiry. This came directly from user feedback and we hope contributes to a better option trading experience.

## Improve trading UX

We also addressed a handful of further usability improvements based on learnings from our beta testers ðŸ™Œ A lot of work happened behind the scenes this week, but week over week we endeavor to always be improving the dapp.
