## Migrate to WalletConnect v2

[WalletConnect v2](https://walletconnect.com/) was a breaking change that all integrating dapps faced in June. We worked through a number of edge cases to ensure that the transition was as smooth as possible for all manner of OS / browser / wallet combos.

## Migrate from ethers to viem

We updated to [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) v1 and in the process moved from [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) to [viem](https://viem.sh/). While ethers has been a reliable and high-quality framework, with viem we get:
- reduced bundle size resulting in faster page loads,
- better type safety resulting in fewer future bugs,
- and better support for more wallet connectors.

## Expiry usability

For the expiries featured in the Valorem Trade dapp, we added a helpful signifier showing how much time remains until expiry. This came directly from user feedback and we hope contributes to a better option trading experience.

We also addressed a handful of further usability improvements based on learnings from our beta testers ðŸ™Œ A lot of work happened behind the scenes this week, but week over week we endeavor to always be improving the dapp.
