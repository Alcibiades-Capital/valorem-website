          Presently, protocols give away token grants. Valorem enables traditional strike option equity grants on ERC-20 Tokens.
      - heading: Uniswap V3 Liquidity Hedging 
        text_markdown: |
          Use a long straddle to hedge Uniswap V3 liquidity pools. This strategy is a suitable hedge for remaining in position at either end of a concentrated LP.

        text_markdown: |
          Use Alchemix to borrow against future yield, buy a Valorem call option with the yield, and voila, a principal protected note.
    heading: This, and much more, will be possible with Valorem.
    text_markdown: |
      We’re building Valorem to unlock advanced hedging strategies in DeFi and enable more efficient yield on-chain. This flexible primitive can be leveraged to create new defi components.
