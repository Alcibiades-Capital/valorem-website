        text_markdown: |
          Clear options are permissionless. Write options on any ERC20 token, and transact with anyone. Our options use the ERC-1155 standard, lowering the viscosity of risk settlement.

          Clear settles options physically via a novel fair settlement algorithm. This minimizes counterparty risk, so you can securely hedge your risk.
